We're going to round out or Jade knowledge with a look at its more advanced features.  Have a list of things you need to iterate over?  We've got you covered.  Want to include Markdown in your template?  There's a filter for that.  Do you want a style question to start a Twitter flame war over?  It's all included in this very special double-digit episode.   When you're done watching this, you'll have all the tools you need to write markup for your Node.js projects.

I tweaked the format a little bit too.  This episode moves faster than previous ones.
